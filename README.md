## Project Details

### The Team
This was a solo project.

### Problem
Building awareness for online personal training services and products to help people get fit by Heroicfit.

As a result, client wants a landing page with the primary goal to provide free resources that help people with training and meal planning.

On the tech side, I wanted more experience with developing appealing UX/UI and learning tailwind CSS.

### Who Is This For
Users who want access to world class personal training affordably so they can look, feel and achieve the physique and fitness they want.

The landing page specifically, is targeted to let users experience personal training level expertise for free to get a taste of the results they could achieve.

### Planning
Looked at a lot of designs for landing pages on dribbble for fitness sites and out of industry to get ideas which I collected in a Figma file. Then looked at competitor online personal training companies and what they were doing for their landing pages and added to the Figma file. 

From here I created a low fidelity wireframe which I then used to practise using tailwind CSS. After doing all bare bones section for landing page, went bacjk to Figma to rework a high fidelity wireframe which you can view in the brief video application demo above.

Goal for the MVP is to build the high fidelity landing page using tailwind CSS, then integrate with an email marketing service for free resource opt ins.

### Tech Tools

| Front-end   | Tools        |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| React       | Figma        |
| TailwindCSS | Dribbble     |
|             | Mailchimp API|

### Features

### Reflection
- Figma is a great tool for prototypes and hi-fi designs 
- It's really important to understand the problem you're trying to solve, so you have more clarity on the solution you're building for
- Really like tailwindCSS, requires knowing css first but docs are really well written and easy to implement. I like that it helped me think in mobile first design with its media queries setup.
- Figuring out how to give users free resources through email, might go down the route of using netlify serverless functions with mailchimp api
