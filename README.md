## Brief Application Demo

## Project Details

*In Progress*

### The Team
This was a solo project

### Problem
An in person personal trainer who because of the pandemic originally had to take their business online, and help people get fit without necessarily being physically there but producing just as effective results, if not more. 

As a result client wants to create a landing page that can provide free resources that help people with training and meal planning for people who are searching for possibly a personal trainer or expertise from a personal trainer that is effective and can give them an insight into the results they could achieve and what it might be like to work with them.

On the tech side, I wanted more experience with developing appealing UX/UI and learning tailwind CSS.

### Who Is This For
Users who want access to world class personal training affordably so they can look, feel and achieve the physique and fitness they want.

The landing page specifically, is targeted to let users experience personal training level expertise for free to get a taste of the results you could achieve.

### Planning
Looked at a lot of designs for landing pages on dribbble for fitness sites and out of industry to get ideas which I collected in a Figma file. Then looked at competitor online personal training companies and what they were doing for their landing pages and added to the Figma file. 

From here I created a low fidelity wireframe which I then used to practise using tailwind CSS. After doing all bare bones section for landing page, went bacjk to Figma to rework a high fidelity wireframe.
